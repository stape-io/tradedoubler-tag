# Tradedoubler Tag for Google Tag Manager Server-Side

The **Tradedoubler Tag for GTM Server-Side** enables server-to-server (S2S) tracking by sending events to Tradedoubler‚Äôs conversion tracking endpoint. It supports event types for **Page View**, **User Data**, and **Conversion** with options to manage cookies, send hashed user identifiers, and include product-level tracking data.

## How to Use

1. Add the **Tradedoubler Tag** to your Server GTM container.
2. Select the **Event Type**:
   - **Page View** ‚Äî Stores Click ID (`tduid`) and Cashback Click ID (`tdclid_sn`) from the URL into cookies.
   - **User Data** ‚Äî Sends hashed identifiers such as email or user ID for user matching.
   - **Conversion** ‚Äî Sends conversion details to Tradedoubler, including optional product-level data.
3. For **Page View** events:
   - Configure the parameter names for Click IDs (`tduid`, `tdclid_sn`) if different from the defaults.
   - Optionally set cookie expiration (days), domain, and HttpOnly flag.

   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è The `tduid` is a click identifier that contains rich information about the click and is Tradedoubler‚Äôs most accurate form of tracking.
   > The `tdclid_sn` is a tracking identifier used by cashback and loyalty publishers.

4. For **User Data** events:
   - Provide a user identifier such as **email**, **user ID**, or **device ID**.
   - Optionally provide **Device ID** and redact IP address.
5. For **Conversion** events:
   - Provide **Event ID**, **Conversion Type**, and either **Organization ID** or the combination of **Program ID** and **Publisher Site ID**.
   - Provide the **Order/Lead Number** and **Order Value** (for `sales`).
   - Optionally provide **Currency**, **Voucher**, **Product List**, and Click IDs (`tduid`, `tdclid_sn`).
   - Enable **Product Level Tracking (PLT)** for sending detailed product information.
6. Configure **Consent Settings** to control whether data is sent always or only if marketing consent is given.
7. Optionally enable **Logging**:
   - Console logs during preview/debug or always.
   - BigQuery logs for storing event data in your Google Cloud project.
